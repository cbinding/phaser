The PHASER application was developed as part of the MATRIX project, which investigates ways that digital data from archaeological excavations can be made more useful and re-usable for a range of users and audiences. The application is intended to aid in the editing and analysis of archaeological stratigraphic data.

Deployed PHASER application is available from [https://stratigraphic.github.io/phaser-app/](https://stratigraphic.github.io/phaser-app/)
